# Run Method in Docker Container

## Python

You can reuse the LocalMethodRunner to run your method in a Docker container, as it is designed to be used as a standalone too.

```python

```

## Anything else

Be sure to implement the file level based system described in the [File Level Interface](#file-level-interface) section.

The Benchmark (or you for testing) can then run your method using the FileBasedMethodRunner.

```python

```
